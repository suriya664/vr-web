  You are an expert in JavaScript, React Native, Expo, and Mobile UI development.
  
  Code Style and Structure:
  - Write Clean, Readable Code: Ensure your code is easy to read and understand. Use descriptive names for variables and functions.
  - Use Functional Components: Prefer functional components with hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) over class components.
  - Component Modularity: Break down components into smaller, reusable pieces. Keep components focused on a single responsibility.
  - Organize Files by Feature: Group related components, hooks, and styles into feature-based directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  Naming Conventions:
  - Variables and Functions: Use camelCase for variables and functions (e.g., isFetchingData, handleUserInput).
  - Components: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., UserProfile, ChatScreen).
  - Directories: Use lowercase and hyphenated names for directories (e.g., user-profile, chat-screen).

  JavaScript Usage:
  - Avoid Global Variables: Minimize the use of global variables to prevent unintended side effects.
  - Use ES6+ Features: Leverage ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, and template literals to write concise code.
  - PropTypes: Use PropTypes for type checking in components if you're not using TypeScript.

  Performance Optimization:
  - Optimize State Management: Avoid unnecessary state updates and use local state only when needed.
  - Memoization: Use React.memo() for functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
  - FlatList Optimization: Optimize FlatList with props like removeClippedSubviews, maxToRenderPerBatch, and windowSize.
  - Avoid Anonymous Functions: Refrain from using anonymous functions in renderItem or event handlers to prevent re-renders.

  UI and Styling:
  - Consistent Styling: Use StyleSheet.create() for consistent styling or Styled Components for dynamic styles.
  - Responsive Design: Ensure your design adapts to various screen sizes and orientations. Consider using responsive units and libraries like react-native-responsive-screen.
  - Optimize Image Handling: Use optimized image libraries like react-native-fast-image to handle images efficiently.

  Best Practices:
  - Follow React Native's Threading Model: Be aware of how React Native handles threading to ensure smooth UI performance.
  - Use Expo Tools: Utilize Expo's EAS Build and Updates for continuous deployment and Over-The-Air (OTA) updates.
  - Expo Router: Use Expo Router for file-based routing in your React Native app. It provides native navigation, deep linking, and works across Android, iOS, and web. Refer to the official documentation for setup and usage: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction/

You are an expert in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, AJAX, and Animation development.

HTML Best Practices:
- Semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML5 elements (header, nav, main, article, section, aside, footer) instead of generic divs
- Document Structure: Use proper DOCTYPE, html lang attribute, and well-structured head and body sections
- Meta Tags: Include essential meta tags (viewport, charset, description, keywords)
- Form Structure: Use proper form elements with labels, placeholders, and validation attributes
- Accessibility: Include proper ARIA labels, alt text for images, and ensure proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6)
- Performance: Minimize DOM elements, use lazy loading for images, and optimize HTML structure

CSS Best Practices:
- Modern CSS: Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts instead of floats and tables
- Responsive Design: Implement mobile-first approach with media queries and relative units (rem, em, %, vw, vh)
- CSS Variables: Use CSS custom properties (--variable-name) for theming and maintainability
- BEM Methodology: Follow Block Element Modifier naming convention for CSS classes
- Specificity: Avoid overly specific selectors; prefer classes over IDs for styling
- Performance: Minimize CSS, use efficient selectors, avoid deep nesting
- Organization: Structure CSS with comments, group related styles, and use consistent formatting
- Browser Compatibility: Use vendor prefixes when necessary and test across major browsers

JavaScript Best Practices:
- ES6+ Features: Use modern JavaScript features (arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, async/await, modules)
- Code Organization: Use modules (ES6 imports/exports), organize code into logical files and folders
- Naming Conventions: Use camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for constructors/classes, UPPER_CASE for constants
- Functions: Prefer arrow functions, use function declarations for hoisting needs, avoid function expressions in loops
- Error Handling: Implement try-catch blocks, handle promises with .catch(), validate inputs, provide meaningful error messages
- Performance: Avoid memory leaks, use debouncing/throttling for events, optimize loops, minimize DOM manipulation
- DOM Manipulation: Cache DOM queries, use DocumentFragment for batch updates, prefer modern APIs (querySelector over getElementById)
- Event Handling: Use event delegation, remove event listeners when not needed, prevent default behavior appropriately
- Security: Sanitize user inputs, avoid eval(), use Content Security Policy, validate data on both client and server side

Bootstrap Best Practices:
- Grid System: Use Bootstrap's responsive grid system (container, row, col) for layouts
- Components: Leverage Bootstrap components (navbar, cards, buttons, modals, forms, dropdowns) instead of building from scratch
- Utilities: Use Bootstrap utility classes for spacing, colors, typography, and display properties
- Customization: Customize Bootstrap using CSS variables or SASS variables, avoid modifying core Bootstrap files
- Responsive Breakpoints: Use Bootstrap's breakpoints (xs, sm, md, lg, xl, xxl) for responsive design
- JavaScript Components: Initialize Bootstrap JavaScript components properly (modals, dropdowns, tooltips, popovers)
- CDN vs Local: Use Bootstrap CDN for quick prototyping, use npm/package manager for production builds
- Version Compatibility: Stay updated with Bootstrap version and check component API changes
- Accessibility: Ensure Bootstrap components are accessible, add ARIA labels when needed
- Custom CSS: Override Bootstrap styles with custom CSS when necessary, use specificity correctly

AJAX Best Practices:
- XMLHttpRequest: Use XMLHttpRequest for older browser support, handle readyState and status codes properly
- Fetch API: Prefer Fetch API for modern browsers, use async/await for cleaner code
- Error Handling: Always handle errors (network failures, HTTP errors, timeouts) with try-catch or .catch()
- Loading States: Show loading indicators during AJAX requests, provide user feedback
- Request Methods: Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for removal)
- Headers: Set proper Content-Type headers (application/json, application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data)
- CORS: Handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing properly, understand preflight requests
- Timeouts: Set reasonable timeout values for AJAX requests
- Abort: Implement request cancellation using AbortController for Fetch API
- Data Format: Use JSON for data exchange, parse responses correctly
- Security: Validate and sanitize data before sending, never send sensitive data in GET requests
- Progress: Show upload/download progress when dealing with large files

Animation Best Practices:
- CSS Animations: Use CSS @keyframes and animation properties for simple animations
- CSS Transitions: Use CSS transitions for hover effects, state changes, and smooth property changes
- Transform Properties: Use transform (translate, scale, rotate) instead of changing position/size for better performance
- Opacity: Animate opacity for fade effects, combine with transform for smooth animations
- Performance: Use will-change property sparingly, prefer transform and opacity for GPU acceleration
- JavaScript Animations: Use requestAnimationFrame for JavaScript-based animations, avoid setInterval/setTimeout
- Animation Libraries: Consider using libraries (GSAP, Anime.js, Framer Motion) for complex animations
- Timing Functions: Use appropriate easing functions (ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier)
- Duration: Keep animation durations short (200-500ms for UI interactions, 500-1000ms for page transitions)
- Reduced Motion: Respect prefers-reduced-motion media query for accessibility
- Animation States: Manage animation states properly, handle animation completion events
- Browser Support: Test animations across browsers, use vendor prefixes when necessary
